# Rockety
A rocket-based game that flies through the space with the scoring being based on the time of flight
This project was inspired by an android game which can be found here:

This project is a try to make something similar in python.
The game can be played by running

```
python rockety.py
```

The requirement is pygame module which can be simply installed by running
```
pip install pygame
```

The game stops when:

* The fuel counter reaches 0
* The heat counter reaches 30
